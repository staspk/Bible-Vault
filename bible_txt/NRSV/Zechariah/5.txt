Again I looked up and saw a flying scroll.
And he said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.”
Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land, for everyone who has stolen, as is forbidden on one side, has gone unpunished, and everyone who has sworn falsely, as is forbidden on the other side, has gone unpunished.
I have sent it out, says the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name, and it shall abide in that house and consume it, both timber and stones.”
Then the angel who spoke with me came forward and said to me, “Look up and see what this is that is coming out.”
I said, “What is it?” He said, “This is a basket coming out.” And he said, “This is their iniquity in the whole land.”
Then a leaden cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting in the basket!
And he said, “This is Wickedness.” So he thrust her back into the basket and pressed the leaden weight down on its mouth.
Then I looked up and saw two women coming forward. The wind was in their wings; they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between earth and sky.
Then I said to the angel who spoke with me, “Where are they taking the basket?”
He said to me, “To the land of Shinar, to build a house for it, and when this is prepared, they will set it down there on its base.”
