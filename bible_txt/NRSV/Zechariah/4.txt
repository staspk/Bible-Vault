The angel who spoke with me came again and wakened me, as one is wakened from sleep.
He said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it; there are seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.
And by it there are two olive trees, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”
I said to the angel who spoke with me, “What are these, my lord?”
Then the angel who spoke with me answered me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”
He said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the Lord of hosts.
What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain, and he shall bring out the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’ ”
Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you.
For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel.“These seven are the eyes of the Lord that range through the whole earth.”
Then I said to him, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”
And a second time I said to him, “What are these two branches of the olive trees that pour out the oil through the two golden pipes?”
He said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”
Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.”
