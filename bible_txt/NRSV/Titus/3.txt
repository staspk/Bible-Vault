Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show every courtesy to everyone.
For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, despicable, hating one another.
But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared,
he saved us, not because of any works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy, through the water of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.
This Spirit he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
The saying is sure.I desire that you insist on these things, so that those who have come to believe in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works; these things are excellent and profitable to everyone.

After a first and second admonition, have nothing more to do with anyone who causes divisions,

When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
Make every effort to send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way, and see that they lack nothing.
And let people learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet urgent needs, so that they may not be unproductive.
All who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith.Grace be with all of you.
