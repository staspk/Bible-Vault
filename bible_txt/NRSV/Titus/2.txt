But as for you, teach what is consistent with sound instruction.
Tell the older men to be temperate, serious, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love, and in endurance.
Likewise, tell the older women to be reverent in behavior, not to be slanderers or enslaved to much wine; they are to teach what is good,
so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be self-controlled, chaste, good managers of the household, kind, submissive to their husbands, so that the word of God may not be discredited.
Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled
in all things, offering yourself as a model of good works and in your teaching offering integrity, gravity,
and sound speech that cannot be censured; then any opponent will be put to shame, having nothing evil to say of us.
Urge slaves to be submissive to their masters in everything, to be pleasing, not talking back,
not stealing, but showing complete and perfect fidelity, so that in everything they may be an ornament to the teaching of God our Savior.
For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all,
training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions and in the present age to live lives that are self-controlled, upright, and godly,
while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
He it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.
Declare these things; exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one look down on you.
