One day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the Lord, and the accuser also came among them to present himself before the Lord.
The Lord said to the accuser, “Where have you come from?” The accuser answered the Lord, “From going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it.”
The Lord said to the accuser, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil. He still persists in his integrity, although you incited me against him, to destroy him for no reason.”
Then the accuser answered the Lord, “Skin for skin! All that the man has he will give for his life.
But stretch out your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.”
The Lord said to the accuser, “Very well, he is in your power; only spare his life.”
So the accuser went out from the presence of the Lord and inflicted loathsome sores on Job from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
Job took a potsherd with which to scrape himself and sat among the ashes.
Then his wife said to him, “Do you still persist in your integrity? Curse God and die.”
But he said to her, “You speak as any foolish woman would speak. Shall we receive good from God and not receive evil?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
Now when Job’s three friends heard of all these troubles that had come upon him, each of them set out from his home—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to go and console and comfort him.
When they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him, and they raised their voices and wept aloud; they tore their robes and threw dust in the air upon their heads.
They sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.
