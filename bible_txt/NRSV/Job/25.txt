Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
“Dominion and fear are with God;    he makes peace in his high heaven.
Is there any number to his armies?    Upon whom does his light not arise?
How then can a mortal be righteous before God?    How can one born of woman be pure?
If even the moon is not bright    and the stars are not pure in his sight,
how much less a mortal, who is a maggot,    and a human being, who is a worm!”
