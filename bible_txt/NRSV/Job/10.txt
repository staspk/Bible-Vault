“I loathe my life;    I will give free utterance to my complaint;    I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me;    let me know why you contend against me.
Does it seem good to you to oppress,    to despise the work of your hands    and favor the schemes of the wicked?
Do you have eyes of flesh?    Do you see as humans see?
Are your days like the days of mortals    or your years like human years,
that you seek out my iniquity    and search for my sin,
although you know that I am not guilty,    and there is no one to deliver out of your hand?
Your hands fashioned and made me,    and now you turn and destroy me.
Remember that you fashioned me like clay,    and will you turn me to dust again?
Did you not pour me out like milk    and curdle me like cheese?
You clothed me with skin and flesh    and knit me together with bones and sinews.
You have granted me life and steadfast love,    and your care has preserved my spirit.
Yet these things you hid in your heart;    I know that this was your purpose.
If I sin, you watch me    and do not acquit me of my iniquity.
If I am wicked, woe to me!    If I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head,for I am filled with disgrace    and look upon my affliction.
Bold as a lion you hunt me;    you repeat your exploits against me.
You renew your witnesses against me    and increase your vexation toward me;    you bring fresh troops against me.
“ ‘Why did you bring me forth from the womb?    Would that I had died before any eye had seen me
and were as though I had not been,    carried from the womb to the grave.
Are not the days of my life few?    Let me alone, that I may find a little comfort
before I go, never to return,    to the land of gloom and deep darkness,
the land of gloom and chaos,    where light is like darkness.’ ”
