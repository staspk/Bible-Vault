Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
“Should a multitude of words go unanswered,    and should one full of talk be vindicated?
Should your babble put others to silence,    and when you mock, shall no one shame you?
For you say, ‘My conduct is pure,    and I am clean in God’s sight.’
But O that God would speak    and open his lips to you
and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom!    For wisdom is many-sided.Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves.
“Can you find out the deep things of God?    Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?
It is higher than heaven—what can you do?    Deeper than Sheol—what can you know?
Its measure is longer than the earth    and broader than the sea.
If he passes through and imprisons    and assembles for judgment, who can hinder him?
For he knows those who are worthless;    when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it?
But the stupid will get understanding    when a wild ass is born human.
“If you direct your heart rightly,    you will stretch out your hands toward him.
If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away,    and do not let wickedness reside in your tents.
Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish;    you will be secure and will not fear.
You will forget your misery;    you will remember it as waters that have passed away.
And your life will be brighter than the noonday;    its darkness will be like the morning.
And you will have confidence because there is hope;    you will be protected and take your rest in safety.
You will lie down, and no one will make you afraid;    many will entreat your favor.
But the eyes of the wicked will fail;    all way of escape will be lost to them,    and their hope is to breathe their last.”
