So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became angry. He was angry at Job because he justified himself rather than God;
he was angry also at Job’s three friends because they had found no answer, though they had declared Job to be in the wrong.
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he.
But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he became angry.
Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answered:“I am young in years,    and you are aged;therefore I was timid and afraid    to declare my opinion to you.
I said, ‘Let days speak    and many years teach wisdom.’
But truly it is the spirit in a mortal,    the breath of the Almighty that makes for understanding.
It is not the old who are wise    nor the aged who understand what is right.
Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me;    let me also declare my opinion.’
“See, I waited for your words;    I listened for your wise sayings    while you searched out what to say.
I gave you my attention,    but there was, in fact, no one who confuted Job,    no one among you who answered his words.
Yet do not say, ‘We have found wisdom;    God may vanquish him, not a human.’
He has not directed his words against me,    and I will not answer him with your speeches.
“They are dismayed; they answer no more;    they have not a word to say.
And am I to wait because they do not speak,    because they stand there and answer no more?
I also will give my answer;    I also will declare my opinion.
For I am full of words;    the spirit within me constrains me.
My belly is indeed like wine that has no vent;    like new wineskins, it is ready to burst.
I must speak, so that I may find relief;    I must open my lips and answer.
I will not show partiality to any person    or use flattery toward anyone.
For I do not know how to flatter—    or my Maker would soon put an end to me!
