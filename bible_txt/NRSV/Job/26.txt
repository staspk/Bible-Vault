Then Job answered:
“How you have helped one who has no power!    How you have assisted the arm that has no strength!
How you have counseled one who has no wisdom    and given much good advice!
With whose help have you uttered words,    and whose spirit has come forth from you?
The shades below tremble,    the waters and their inhabitants.
Sheol is naked before God,    and Abaddon has no covering.
He stretches out Zaphon over the void    and hangs the earth upon nothing.
He binds up the waters in his thick clouds,    and the cloud is not torn open by them.
He covers the face of the full moon    and spreads over it his cloud.
He has described a circle on the face of the waters,    at the boundary between light and darkness.
The pillars of heaven tremble    and are astounded at his rebuke.
By his power he stilled the Sea;    by his understanding he struck down Rahab.
By his wind the heavens were made fair;    his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
These are indeed but the outskirts of his ways,    and how small a whisper do we hear of him!    But the thunder of his power who can understand?”
