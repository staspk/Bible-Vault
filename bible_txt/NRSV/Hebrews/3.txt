Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partners in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,
who was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses also “was faithful in all God’s house.”
Yet Jesus is worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
(For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)
Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken later.
Christ, however, was faithful over God’s house as a son, and we are his house if we hold firm the boldness and the pride inspired by hope.
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,“Today, if you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,    as on the day of testing in the wilderness,
where your ancestors put me to the test,though they had seen my works
for forty years.Therefore I was angry with that generation,and I said, ‘They always go astray in their hearts,    and they have not known my ways.’
As in my anger I swore,    ‘They will not enter my rest.’ ”
Take care, brothers and sisters, that none of you may have an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.
But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
For we have become partners of Christ, if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end.
As it is said,“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
Now who were they who heard and rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?
And with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to those who were disobedient?
So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
