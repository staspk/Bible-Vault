The Lord spoke to Moses,
“See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
and I have filled him with a divine spirit, with ability, intelligence, and knowledge, and every kind of skill,
to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze,
in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, to work in every kind of craft.
Moreover, I have appointed with him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, and I have given skill to all the skillful, so that they may make all that I have commanded you:
the tent of meeting, and the ark of the covenant, and the cover that is on it, and all the furnishings of the tent,
the table and its utensils, and the pure lampstand with all its utensils, and the altar of incense,
and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand,
and the finely worked vestments, the holy vestments for the priest Aaron and the vestments of his sons, for their service as priests,
and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense for the holy place. They shall do just as I have commanded you.”
The Lord said to Moses,
“You yourself are to speak to the Israelites, ‘You shall surely keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, given in order that you may know that I, the Lord, sanctify you.
You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you; everyone who profanes it shall be put to death; whoever does any work on it shall be cut off from among the people.
Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the Lord; whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death.
Therefore the Israelites shall keep the Sabbath, observing the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a perpetual covenant.
It is a sign forever between me and the Israelites that in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’ ”
When God finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.
