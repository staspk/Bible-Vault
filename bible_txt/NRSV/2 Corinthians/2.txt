1 So I made up my mind not to make another visit that causes you grief.
For if I cause you grief, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have grieved?
And I wrote as I did, so that when I came, I might not suffer grief from those who should have made me rejoice, for I am confident about all of you, that my joy would be the joy of all of you.
For I wrote you out of much distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you grief but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.
But if anyone has caused grief, he has caused it not to me but to some extent—not to exaggerate it—to all of you.
This punishment by the majority is enough for such a person;
so now instead you should forgive and console him, so that he may not be overwhelmed by even worse grief.
So I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.
I wrote for this reason: to test you and to know whether you are obedient in everything.
Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. In fact, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ.
And we do this so that we may not be outwitted by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his designs.
When I came to Troas to proclaim the good news of Christ, a door was opened for me in the Lord,
but my mind could not rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said farewell to them and went on to Macedonia.
But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him.
For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing:
to the one group a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is qualified for these things?
For we are not peddlers of God’s word like so many, but as persons of sincerity, as persons sent from God, we are speaking in Christ before God.
