Now concerning the collection for the saints: you should follow the directions I gave to the churches of Galatia.
On the first day of every week, each of you is to put aside and save whatever extra you earn, so that collections need not be taken when I come.
And when I arrive, I will send any whom you approve with letters to take your gift to Jerusalem.
If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me.
I will visit you after passing through Macedonia—for I intend to pass through Macedonia—
and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way, wherever I go.
I do not want to see you now just in passing, for I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.
But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,
for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
If Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord just as I am;
therefore let no one despise him. Send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers and sisters.
Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers and sisters, but he was not at all willing to come now. He will come when he has the opportunity.
Keep alert; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong.
Let all that you do be done in love.
Now, brothers and sisters, you know that members of the household of Stephanas were the first fruits in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints;
I urge you to put yourselves at the service of such people and of everyone who works and toils with them.
I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence,
for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. So give recognition to such persons.
The churches of Asia send greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, greet you warmly in the Lord.
All the brothers and sisters send greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.
Let anyone be accursed who has no love for the Lord. Our Lord, come!
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.
