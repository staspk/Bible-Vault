On the day when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle and had anointed and consecrated it with all its furnishings and had anointed and consecrated the altar with all its utensils,
the leaders of Israel, heads of their ancestral houses, the leaders of the tribes, who were over those who were enrolled, made offerings.
They brought their offerings before the Lord, six covered wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two of the leaders and for each one an ox; they presented them before the tabernacle.
Then the Lord said to Moses,
“Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the tent of meeting, and give them to the Levites, to each according to his service.”
So Moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the Gershonites, according to their service,
and four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the Merarites, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
But to the Kohathites he gave none, because they were charged with the care of the holy things that had to be carried on the shoulders.
