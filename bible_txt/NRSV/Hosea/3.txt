The Lord said to me again, “Go, love a woman who has a lover and is an adulteress, just as the Lord loves the people of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.”
So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer of barley and a measure of wine.
And I said to her, “You must remain as mine for many days; you shall not prostitute yourself; you shall not have intercourse with a man, nor I with you.”
For the Israelites shall remain many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or pillar, without ephod or teraphim.
Afterward the Israelites shall return and seek the Lord their God and David their king; they shall come in awe to the Lord and to his goodness in the latter days.
