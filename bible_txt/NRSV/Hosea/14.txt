Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God,    for you have stumbled because of your iniquity.
Take words with you    and return to the Lord;say to him,    “Take away all guilt;accept that which is good,    and we will offer    the fruit of our lips.
Assyria shall not save us;    we will not ride upon horses;we will say no more, ‘Our God,’    to the work of our hands.In you the orphan finds mercy.”
I will heal their disloyalty;    I will love them freely,    for my anger has turned from them.
I will be like the dew to Israel;    he shall blossom like the lily;    he shall strike root like the forests of Lebanon.
His shoots shall spread out;    his beauty shall be like the olive tree    and his fragrance like that of Lebanon.
They shall again live beneath my shadow;    they shall flourish as a garden;they shall blossom like the vine;    their fragrance shall be like the wine of Lebanon.
O Ephraim, what have I to do with idols?    It is I who answer and look after you.I am like an evergreen cypress;    your fruit comes from me.
Those who are wise understand these things;    those who are discerning know them.For the ways of the Lord are right,    and the upright walk in them,    but transgressors stumble in them.
