For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent,    and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest,until her vindication shines out like the dawn    and her salvation like a burning torch.
The nations shall see your vindication    and all the kings your glory,and you shall be called by a new name    that the mouth of the Lord will give.
You shall be a beautiful crown in the hand of the Lord    and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
You shall no more be termed Forsaken,    and your land shall no more be termed Desolate,but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her    and your land Married,for the Lord delights in you,    and your land shall be married.
For as a young man marries a young woman,    so shall your builder marry you,and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride,    so shall your God rejoice over you.
Upon your walls, O Jerusalem,    I have posted sentinels;all day and all night    they shall never be silent.You who remind the Lord,    take no rest,
and give him no rest    until he establishes Jerusalem    and makes it renowned throughout the earth.
The Lord has sworn by his right hand    and by his mighty arm:I will not again give your grain    to be food for your enemies,and foreigners shall not drink the wine    for which you have labored,
but those who harvest it shall eat it    and praise the Lord,and those who gather it shall drink it    in my holy courts.
Go through, go through the gates;    prepare the way for the people;build up, build up the highway;    clear it of stones;    lift up an ensign over the peoples.
The Lord has proclaimed    to the end of the earth:Say to daughter Zion,    “Look, your savior comes;his reward is with him    and his recompense before him.”
They shall be called, “The Holy People,    The Redeemed of the Lord,”and you shall be called, “Sought Out,    A City Not Forsaken.”
