An oracle concerning Moab.Because Ar is laid waste in a night,    Moab is undone;because Kir is laid waste in a night,    Moab is undone.
Daughter Dibon has gone up    to the high places to weep;over Nebo and over Medeba    Moab wails.Every head is shaved;    every beard is shorn;
in the streets they bind on sackcloth;    on the housetops and in the squares    everyone wails and melts in tears.
Heshbon and Elealeh cry out;    their voices are heard as far as Jahaz;therefore the loins of Moab quiver;    his soul trembles.
My heart cries out for Moab;    his fugitives flee to Zoar,    to Eglath-shelishiyah.For at the ascent of Luhith    they go up weeping;on the road to Horonaim    they raise a cry of destruction;
the waters of Nimrim    are a desolation;the grass is withered; the new growth fails;    vegetation is no more.
Therefore the abundance they have gained    and what they have laid upthey carry away    over the Wadi of the Willows.
For a cry has gone    around the land of Moab;the wailing reaches to Eglaim;    the wailing reaches to Beer-elim.
For the waters of Dibon are full of blood,    yet I will bring upon Dibon even moreâ€”a lion for those of Moab who escape,    for the remnant of the land.
