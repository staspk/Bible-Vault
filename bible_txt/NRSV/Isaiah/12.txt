You will say on that day:“I will give thanks to you, O Lord,    for though you were angry with me,your anger turned away,    and you comforted me.
Surely God is my salvation;    I will trust and will not be afraid,for the Lord is my strength and my might;    he has become my salvation.”
With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
And you will say on that day:“Give thanks to the Lord;    call on his name;make known his deeds among the nations;    proclaim that his name is exalted.
Sing praises to the Lord, for he has done gloriously;    let this be known in all the earth.
Shout aloud and sing for joy, O royal Zion,    for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.”
