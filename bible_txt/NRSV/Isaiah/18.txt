Woe, land of buzzing wings    beyond the rivers of Cush,
sending ambassadors by the Nile    in vessels of papyrus on the waters!Go, you swift messengers,    to a nation tall and smooth,to a people feared near and far,    a nation mighty and conquering,    whose land the rivers divide.
All you inhabitants of the world,    you who live on the earth,when a signal is raised on the mountains, look!    When a trumpet is blown, listen!
For thus the Lord said to me:“I will quietly look from my dwelling    like clear heat in sunshine,    like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”
For before the harvest, when the blossom is over    and the flower becomes a ripening grape,he will cut off the shoots with pruning hooks,    and the spreading branches he will hew away.
They shall all be left    to the birds of prey of the mountains    and to the animals of the earth.And the birds of prey will summer on them,    and all the animals of the earth will winter on them.
At that time gifts will be brought to the Lord of hosts from a people tall and smooth, from a people feared near and far, a nation mighty and conquering, whose land the rivers divide, to Mount Zion, the place of the name of the Lord of hosts.
