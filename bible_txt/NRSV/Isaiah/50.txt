Thus says the Lord:Where is your motherâ€™s bill of divorce    with which I dismissed her?Or which of my creditors is it    to whom I have sold you?No, because of your sins you were sold,    and for your transgressions your mother was dismissed.
Why was no one there when I came?    Why did no one answer when I called?Is my arm powerless to redeem?    Or have I no strength to deliver?By my rebuke I dry up the sea;    I make the rivers a desert,so that their fish stink for lack of water    and die of thirst.
I clothe the heavens with blackness    and make sackcloth their covering.
The Lord God has given me    a trained tongue,that I may know how to sustain    the weary with a word.Morning by morning he wakens,    wakens my ear    to listen as those who are taught.
The Lord God has opened my ear,    and I was not rebellious;    I did not turn backward.
I gave my back to those who struck me    and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;I did not hide my face    from insult and spitting.
The Lord God helps me;    therefore I have not been disgraced;therefore I have set my face like flint,    and I know that I shall not be put to shame;
he who vindicates me is near.Who will contend with me?    Let us stand in court together.Who are my adversaries?    Let them confront me.
It is the Lord God who helps me;    who will declare me guilty?All of them will wear out like a garment;    the moth will eat them up.
Who among you fears the Lord    and obeys the voice of his servant,who walks in darkness    and has no light,yet trusts in the name of the Lord    and relies upon his God?
But all of you are kindlers of fire,    lighters of firebrands.Walk in the flame of your fire    and among the brands that you have kindled!This is what you shall have from my hand:    you shall lie down in torment.
