Bel bows down; Nebo stoops;    their idols are on beasts and cattle;these things you carry are loaded    as burdens on weary animals.
They stoop; they bow down together;    they cannot save the burden    but themselves go into captivity.
Listen to me, O house of Jacob,    all the remnant of the house of Israel,who have been borne by me from your birth,    carried from the womb;
even to your old age I am he;    even when you turn gray I will carry you.I have made, and I will bear;    I will carry and will save.
To whom will you liken me and make me equal    and compare me, as though we were alike?
Those who lavish gold from the purse    and weigh out silver in the scales—they hire a goldsmith, who makes it into a god;    then they fall down and worship!
They lift it to their shoulders; they carry it;    they set it in its place, and it stands there;    it cannot move from its place.If one cries out to it, it does not answer    or save anyone from trouble.
Remember this and consider;    recall it to mind, you transgressors;
remember the former things of old,for I am God, and there is no other;    I am God, and there is no one like me,
declaring the outcome from the beginning    and from ancient times things not yet done,saying, “My purpose shall stand,    and I will fulfill my intention,”
calling a bird of prey from the east,    the man for my purpose from a far country.I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass;    I have planned, and I will do it.
Listen to me, you stubborn of heart,    you who are far from deliverance:
I bring near my deliverance; it is not far off,    and my salvation will not tarry;I will put salvation in Zion,    for Israel my glory.
