Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the belly of the fish,
saying,“I called to the Lord out of my distress,    and he answered me;out of the belly of Sheol I cried,    and you heard my voice.
You cast me into the deep,    into the heart of the seas,    and the flood surrounded me;all your waves and your billows    passed over me.
Then I said, ‘I am driven away    from your sight;how shall I look again    upon your holy temple?’
The waters closed in over me;    the deep surrounded me;weeds were wrapped around my head
at the roots of the mountains.I went down to the land    whose bars closed upon me forever;yet you brought up my life from the Pit,    O Lord my God.
As my life was ebbing away,    I remembered the Lord,and my prayer came to you,    into your holy temple.
Those who worship vain idols    forsake their true loyalty.
But I with the voice of thanksgiving    will sacrifice to you;what I have vowed I will pay.    Deliverance belongs to the Lord!”
Then the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out onto the dry land.
