The Lord is my strength and my song,    and he has become my salvation;this is my God, and I will praise him,    my father's God, and I will exalt him.

Your right hand, O Lord, glorious in power,    your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy.
In the greatness of your majesty you overthrow your adversaries;    you send out your fury; it consumes them like stubble.
At the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up;    the floods stood up in a heap;    the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.
The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake,    I will divide the spoil, my desire shall have its fill of them.    I will draw my sword; my hand shall destroy them.’

“Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?    Who is like you, majestic in holiness,    awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?

“You have led in your steadfast love the people whom you have redeemed;    you have guided them by your strength to your holy abode.
The peoples have heard; they tremble;    pangs have seized the inhabitants of Philistia.
Now are the chiefs of Edom dismayed;    trembling seizes the leaders of Moab;    all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
Terror and dread fall upon them;    because of the greatness of your arm, they are still as a stone,till your people, O Lord, pass by,    till the people pass by whom you have purchased.
You will bring them in and plant them on your own mountain,    the place, O Lord, which you have made for your abode,    the sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have established.
The Lord will reign forever and ever.”
