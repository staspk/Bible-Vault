Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the fish’s belly.
And he said:“I cried out to the Lord because of my affliction,And He answered me.“Out of the belly of Sheol I cried,And You heard my voice.
For You cast me into the deep,Into the heart of the seas,And the floods surrounded me;All Your billows and Your waves passed over me.
Then I said, ‘I have been cast out of Your sight;Yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.’
The waters surrounded me, even to my soul;The deep closed around me;Weeds were wrapped around my head.
I went down to the moorings of the mountains;The earth with its bars closed behind me forever;Yet You have brought up my life from the pit,O Lord, my God.
“When my soul fainted within me,I remembered the Lord;And my prayer went up to You,Into Your holy temple.
“Those who regard worthless idolsForsake their own Mercy.
But I will sacrifice to YouWith the voice of thanksgiving;I will pay what I have vowed.Salvation is of the Lord.”
So the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
