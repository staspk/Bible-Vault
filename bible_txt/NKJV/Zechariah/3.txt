Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him.
And the Lord said to Satan, “The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?”
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the Angel.
Then He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, “Take away the filthy garments from him.” And to him He said, “See, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you with rich robes.”
And I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.”So they put a clean turban on his head, and they put the clothes on him. And the Angel of the Lord stood by.
Then the Angel of the Lord admonished Joshua, saying,
“Thus says the Lord of hosts:‘If you will walk in My ways,And if you will keep My command,Then you shall also judge My house,And likewise have charge of My courts;I will give you places to walkAmong these who stand here.
‘Hear, O Joshua, the high priest,You and your companions who sit before you,For they are a wondrous sign;For behold, I am bringing forth My Servant the BRANCH.
For behold, the stoneThat I have laid before Joshua:Upon the stone are seven eyes.Behold, I will engrave its inscription,’Says the Lord of hosts,‘And I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
In that day,’ says the Lord of hosts,‘Everyone will invite his neighborUnder his vine and under his fig tree.’ ”
