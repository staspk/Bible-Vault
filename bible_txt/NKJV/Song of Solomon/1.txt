The song of songs, which is Solomon’s.The Shulamite
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth—For your love is better than wine.
Because of the fragrance of your good ointments,Your name is ointment poured forth;Therefore the virgins love you.
Draw me away!The Daughters of JerusalemWe will run after you.The ShulamiteThe king has brought me into his chambers.The Daughters of JerusalemWe will be glad and rejoice in you.We will remember your love more than wine.The ShulamiteRightly do they love you.
I am dark, but lovely,O daughters of Jerusalem,Like the tents of Kedar,Like the curtains of Solomon.
Do not look upon me, because I am dark,Because the sun has tanned me.My mother’s sons were angry with me;They made me the keeper of the vineyards,But my own vineyard I have not kept.(To Her Beloved)
Tell me, O you whom I love,Where you feed your flock,Where you make it rest at noon.For why should I be as one who veils herselfBy the flocks of your companions?The Beloved
If you do not know, O fairest among women,Follow in the footsteps of the flock,And feed your little goatsBeside the shepherds’ tents.
I have compared you, my love,To my filly among Pharaoh’s chariots.
Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,Your neck with chains of gold.The Daughters of Jerusalem
We will make you ornaments of goldWith studs of silver.The Shulamite
While the king is at his table,My spikenard sends forth its fragrance.
A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me,That lies all night between my breasts.
My beloved is to me a cluster of henna bloomsIn the vineyards of En Gedi.The Beloved
Behold, you are fair, my love!Behold, you are fair!You have dove’s eyes.The Shulamite
Behold, you are handsome, my beloved!Yes, pleasant!Also our bed is green.
The beams of our houses are cedar,And our rafters of fir.
