The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before Pharaoh attacked Gaza.
Thus says the Lord:“Behold, waters rise out of the north,And shall be an overflowing flood;They shall overflow the land and all that is in it,The city and those who dwell within;Then the men shall cry,And all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.
At the noise of the stamping hooves of his strong horses,At the rushing of his chariots,At the rumbling of his wheels,The fathers will not look back for their children,Lacking courage,
Because of the day that comes to plunder all the Philistines,To cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains;For the Lord shall plunder the Philistines,The remnant of the country of Caphtor.
Baldness has come upon Gaza,Ashkelon is cut offWith the remnant of their valley.How long will you cut yourself?
“O you sword of the Lord,How long until you are quiet?Put yourself up into your scabbard,Rest and be still!
How can it be quiet,Seeing the Lord has given it a chargeAgainst Ashkelon and against the seashore?There He has appointed it.”
