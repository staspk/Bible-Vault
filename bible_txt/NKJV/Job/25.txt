Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
“Dominion and fear belong to Him;He makes peace in His high places.
Is there any number to His armies?Upon whom does His light not rise?
How then can man be righteous before God?Or how can he be pure who is born of a woman?
If even the moon does not shine,And the stars are not pure in His sight,
How much less man, who is a maggot,And a son of man, who is a worm?”
