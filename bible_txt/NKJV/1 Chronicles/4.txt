The sons of Judah were Perez, Hezron, Carmi, Hur, and Shobal.
And Reaiah the son of Shobal begot Jahath, and Jahath begot Ahumai and Lahad. These were the families of the Zorathites.
These were the sons of the father of Etam: Jezreel, Ishma, and Idbash; and the name of their sister was Hazelelponi;
and Penuel was the father of Gedor, and Ezer was the father of Hushah.These were the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephrathah the father of Bethlehem.

The sons of Helah were Zereth, Zohar, and Ethnan;
and Koz begot Anub, Zobebah, and the families of Aharhel the son of Harum.
Now Jabez was more honorable than his brothers, and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, “Because I bore him in pain.”
And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, “Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain!” So God granted him what he requested.
Chelub the brother of Shuhah begot Mehir, who was the father of Eshton.
And Eshton begot Beth-Rapha, Paseah, and Tehinnah the father of Ir-Nahash. These were the men of Rechah.
The sons of Kenaz were Othniel and Seraiah. The sons of Othniel were Hathath,

These were the potters and those who dwell at Netaim and Gederah; there they dwelt with the king for his work.
The sons of Simeon were Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul,
Shallum his son, Mibsam his son, and Mishma his son.
And the sons of Mishma were Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son, and Shimei his son.
Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his brothers did not have many children, nor did any of their families multiply as much as the children of Judah.
They dwelt at Beersheba, Moladah, Hazar Shual,
Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad,
Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag,
Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susim, Beth Biri, and at Shaaraim. These were their cities until the reign of David.
And their villages were Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen, and Ashan—five cities—
and all the villages that were around these cities as far as Baal. These were their dwelling places, and they maintained their genealogy:
Meshobab, Jamlech, and Joshah the son of Amaziah;
Joel, and Jehu the son of Joshibiah, the son of Seraiah, the son of Asiel;

So they went to the entrance of Gedor, as far as the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.
And they found rich, good pasture, and the land was broad, quiet, and peaceful; for some Hamites formerly lived there.
These recorded by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and they attacked their tents and the Meunites who were found there, and utterly destroyed them, as it is to this day. So they dwelt in their place, because there was pasture for their flocks there.
Now some of them, five hundred men of the sons of Simeon, went to Mount Seir, having as their captains Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.
And they defeated the rest of the Amalekites who had escaped. They have dwelt there to this day.
