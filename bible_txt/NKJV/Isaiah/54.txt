“Enlarge the place of your tent,And let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings;Do not spare;Lengthen your cords,And strengthen your stakes.

“Do not fear, for you will not be ashamed;Neither be disgraced, for you will not be put to shame;For you will forget the shame of your youth,And will not remember the reproach of your widowhood anymore.
For your Maker is your husband,The Lord of hosts is His name;And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel;He is called the God of the whole earth.
For the Lord has called youLike a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit,Like a youthful wife when you were refused,”Says your God.
“For a mere moment I have forsaken you,But with great mercies I will gather you.
With a little wrath I hid My face from you for a moment;But with everlasting kindness I will have mercy on you,”Says the Lord, your Redeemer.
“For this is like the waters of Noah to Me;For as I have swornThat the waters of Noah would no longer cover the earth,So have I swornThat I would not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.

“O you afflicted one,Tossed with tempest, and not comforted,Behold, I will lay your stones with colorful gems,And lay your foundations with sapphires.
I will make your pinnacles of rubies,Your gates of crystal,And all your walls of precious stones.
All your children shall be taught by the Lord,And great shall be the peace of your children.
In righteousness you shall be established;You shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear;And from terror, for it shall not come near you.
Indeed they shall surely assemble, but not because of Me.Whoever assembles against you shall fall for your sake.
“Behold, I have created the blacksmithWho blows the coals in the fire,Who brings forth an instrument for his work;And I have created the spoiler to destroy.
No weapon formed against you shall prosper,And every tongue which rises against you in judgmentYou shall condemn.This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord,And their righteousness is from Me,”Says the Lord.
