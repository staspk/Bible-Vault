“Come down and sit in the dust,O virgin daughter of Babylon;Sit on the ground without a throne,O daughter of the Chaldeans!For you shall no more be calledTender and delicate.
Take the millstones and grind meal.Remove your veil,Take off the skirt,Uncover the thigh,Pass through the rivers.
Your nakedness shall be uncovered,Yes, your shame will be seen;I will take vengeance,And I will not arbitrate with a man.”
As for our Redeemer, the Lord of hosts is His name,The Holy One of Israel.
“Sit in silence, and go into darkness,O daughter of the Chaldeans;For you shall no longer be calledThe Lady of Kingdoms.
I was angry with My people;I have profaned My inheritance,And given them into your hand.You showed them no mercy;On the elderly you laid your yoke very heavily.
And you said, ‘I shall be a lady forever,’So that you did not take these things to heart,Nor remember the latter end of them.
“Therefore hear this now, you who are given to pleasures,Who dwell securely,Who say in your heart, ‘I am, and there is no one else besides me;I shall not sit as a widow,Nor shall I know the loss of children’;
But these two things shall come to youIn a moment, in one day:The loss of children, and widowhood.They shall come upon you in their fullnessBecause of the multitude of your sorceries,For the great abundance of your enchantments.
“For you have trusted in your wickedness;You have said, ‘No one sees me’;Your wisdom and your knowledge have warped you;And you have said in your heart,‘I am, and there is no one else besides me.’
Therefore evil shall come upon you;You shall not know from where it arises.And trouble shall fall upon you;You will not be able to put it off.And desolation shall come upon you suddenly,Which you shall not know.
“Stand now with your enchantmentsAnd the multitude of your sorceries,In which you have labored from your youth—Perhaps you will be able to profit,Perhaps you will prevail.
You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels;Let now the astrologers, the stargazers,And the monthly prognosticatorsStand up and save youFrom what shall come upon you.
Behold, they shall be as stubble,The fire shall burn them;They shall not deliver themselvesFrom the power of the flame;It shall not be a coal to be warmed by,Nor a fire to sit before!
Thus shall they be to youWith whom you have labored,Your merchants from your youth;They shall wander each one to his quarter.No one shall save you.
