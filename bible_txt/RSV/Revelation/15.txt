Then I saw another portent in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is ended.
And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands.
And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,“Great and wonderful are thy deeds,O Lord God the Almighty!Just and true are thy ways,O King of the ages!
Who shall not fear and glorify thy name, O Lord?For thou alone art holy.All nations shall come and worship thee,for thy judgments have been revealed.”
After this I looked, and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was opened,
and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, robed in pure bright linen, and their breasts girded with golden girdles.
And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives for ever and ever;
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended.
