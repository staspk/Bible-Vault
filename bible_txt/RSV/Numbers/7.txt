On the day when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed and consecrated it with all its furnishings, and had anointed and consecrated the altar with all its utensils,
the leaders of Israel, heads of their fathers’ houses, the leaders of the tribes, who were over those who were numbered,
offered and brought their offerings before the Lord, six covered wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two of the leaders, and for each one an ox; they offered them before the tabernacle.
Then the Lord said to Moses,
“Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the tent of meeting, and give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service.”
So Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service;
and four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merar′i, according to their service, under the direction of Ith′amar the son of Aaron the priest.
But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because they were charged with the care of the holy things which had to be carried on the shoulder.
And the leaders offered offerings for the dedication of the altar on the day it was anointed; and the leaders offered their offering before the altar.
And the Lord said to Moses, “They shall offer their offerings, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar.”
