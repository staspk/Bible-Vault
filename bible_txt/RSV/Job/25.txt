Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
“Dominion and fear are with God;    he makes peace in his high heaven.
Is there any number to his armies?    Upon whom does his light not arise?
How then can man be righteous before God?    How can he who is born of woman be clean?
Behold, even the moon is not bright    and the stars are not clean in his sight;
how much less man, who is a maggot,    and the son of man, who is a worm!”
