So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
Then Eli′hu the son of Bar′achel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became angry. He was angry at Job because he justified himself rather than God;
he was angry also at Job’s three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong.
Now Eli′hu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he.
And when Eli′hu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he became angry.
And Eli′hu the son of Bar′achel the Buzite answered:“I am young in years,    and you are aged;therefore I was timid and afraid    to declare my opinion to you.
I said, ‘Let days speak,    and many years teach wisdom.’
But it is the spirit in a man,    the breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand.
It is not the old that are wise,    nor the aged that understand what is right.
Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me;    let me also declare my opinion.’
“Behold, I waited for your words,    I listened for your wise sayings,    while you searched out what to say.
I gave you my attention,    and, behold, there was none that confuted Job,    or that answered his words, among you.
Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom;    God may vanquish him, not man.’
He has not directed his words against me,    and I will not answer him with your speeches.
“They are discomfited, they answer no more;    they have not a word to say.
And shall I wait, because they do not speak,    because they stand there, and answer no more?
I also will give my answer;    I also will declare my opinion.
For I am full of words,    the spirit within me constrains me.
Behold, my heart is like wine that has no vent;    like new wineskins, it is ready to burst.
I must speak, that I may find relief;    I must open my lips and answer.
I will not show partiality to any person    or use flattery toward any man.
For I do not know how to flatter,    else would my Maker soon put an end to me.
