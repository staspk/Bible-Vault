You will say in that day:    “I will give thanks to thee, O Lord,    for though thou wast angry with me,thy anger turned away,    and thou didst comfort me.
“Behold, God is my salvation;    I will trust, and will not be afraid;for the Lord God is my strength and my song,    and he has become my salvation.”
With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
And you will say in that day:“Give thanks to the Lord,    call upon his name;make known his deeds among the nations,    proclaim that his name is exalted.
“Sing praises to the Lord, for he has done gloriously;    let this be known in all the earth.
Shout, and sing for joy, O inhabitant of Zion,    for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.”
