Thus says the Lord:“Where is your mother’s bill of divorce,    with which I put her away?Or which of my creditors is it    to whom I have sold you?Behold, for your iniquities you were sold,    and for your transgressions your mother was put away.
Why, when I came, was there no man?    When I called, was there no one to answer?Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem?    Or have I no power to deliver?Behold, by my rebuke I dry up the sea,    I make the rivers a desert;their fish stink for lack of water,    and die of thirst.
I clothe the heavens with blackness,    and make sackcloth their covering.”
The Lord God has given me    the tongue of those who are taught,that I may know how to sustain with a word    him that is weary.Morning by morning he wakens,    he wakens my ear    to hear as those who are taught.
The Lord God has opened my ear,    and I was not rebellious,    I turned not backward.
I gave my back to the smiters,    and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;I hid not my face    from shame and spitting.
For the Lord God helps me;    therefore I have not been confounded;therefore I have set my face like a flint,    and I know that I shall not be put to shame;
he who vindicates me is near.Who will contend with me?    Let us stand up together.Who is my adversary?    Let him come near to me.
Behold, the Lord God helps me;    who will declare me guilty?Behold, all of them will wear out like a garment;    the moth will eat them up.
Who among you fears the Lord    and obeys the voice of his servant,who walks in darkness    and has no light,yet trusts in the name of the Lord    and relies upon his God?
Behold, all you who kindle a fire,    who set brands alight!Walk by the light of your fire,    and by the brands which you have kindled!This shall you have from my hand:    you shall lie down in torment.
