At that time Mero′dach-bal′adan the son of Bal′adan, king of Babylon, sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezeki′ah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
And Hezeki′ah welcomed them; and he showed them his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his whole armory, all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezeki′ah did not show them.
Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezeki′ah, and said to him, “What did these men say? And whence did they come to you?” Hezeki′ah said, “They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon.”
He said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezeki′ah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”
Then Isaiah said to Hezeki′ah, “Hear the word of the Lord of hosts:
Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the Lord.
And some of your own sons, who are born to you, shall be taken away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
Then said Hezeki′ah to Isaiah, “The word of the Lord which you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “There will be peace and security in my days.”
