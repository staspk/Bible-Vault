For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent,    and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest,until her vindication goes forth as brightness,    and her salvation as a burning torch.
The nations shall see your vindication,    and all the kings your glory;and you shall be called by a new name    which the mouth of the Lord will give.
You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord,    and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
You shall no more be termed Forsaken,    and your land shall no more be termed Desolate;but you shall be called My delight is in her,    and your land Married;for the Lord delights in you,    and your land shall be married.
For as a young man marries a virgin,    so shall your sons marry you,and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride,    so shall your God rejoice over you.
Upon your walls, O Jerusalem,    I have set watchmen;all the day and all the night    they shall never be silent.You who put the Lord in remembrance,    take no rest,
and give him no rest    until he establishes Jerusalem    and makes it a praise in the earth.
The Lord has sworn by his right hand    and by his mighty arm:“I will not again give your grain    to be food for your enemies,and foreigners shall not drink your wine    for which you have labored;
but those who garner it shall eat it    and praise the Lord,and those who gather it shall drink it    in the courts of my sanctuary.”
Go through, go through the gates,    prepare the way for the people;build up, build up the highway,    clear it of stones,    lift up an ensign over the peoples.
Behold, the Lord has proclaimed    to the end of the earth:Say to the daughter of Zion,    “Behold, your salvation comes;behold, his reward is with him,    and his recompense before him.”
And they shall be called The holy people,    The redeemed of the Lord;and you shall be called Sought out,    a city not forsaken.
