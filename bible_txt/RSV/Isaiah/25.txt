O Lord, thou art my God;I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name;for thou hast done wonderful things,    plans formed of old, faithful and sure.
For thou hast made the city a heap,    the fortified city a ruin;the palace of aliens is a city no more,    it will never be rebuilt.
Therefore strong peoples will glorify thee;    cities of ruthless nations will fear thee.
For thou hast been a stronghold to the poor,    a stronghold to the needy in his distress,    a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat;for the blast of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall,
like heat in a dry place.Thou dost subdue the noise of the aliens;    as heat by the shade of a cloud,    so the song of the ruthless is stilled.
On this mountain the Lord of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wine on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wine on the lees well refined.
And he will destroy on this mountain the covering that is cast over all peoples, the veil that is spread over all nations.
He will swallow up death for ever, and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth; for the Lord has spoken.
It will be said on that day, “Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, that he might save us. This is the Lord; we have waited for him; let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.”
For the hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain, and Moab shall be trodden down in his place, as straw is trodden down in a dung-pit.
And he will spread out his hands in the midst of it as a swimmer spreads his hands out to swim; but the Lord will lay low his pride together with the skill of his hands.
And the high fortifications of his walls he will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground, even to the dust.
