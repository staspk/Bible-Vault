An oracle concerning Moab.    Because Ar is laid waste in a night    Moab is undone;because Kir is laid waste in a night    Moab is undone.
The daughter of Dibon has gone up    to the high places to weep;over Nebo and over Med′eba    Moab wails.On every head is baldness,    every beard is shorn;
in the streets they gird on sackcloth;    on the housetops and in the squares    every one wails and melts in tears.
Heshbon and Ele-a′leh cry out,    their voice is heard as far as Jahaz;therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud;    his soul trembles.
My heart cries out for Moab;    his fugitives flee to Zo′ar,    to Eg′lath-shelish′iyah.For at the ascent of Luhith    they go up weeping;on the road to Horona′im    they raise a cry of destruction;
the waters of Nimrim    are a desolation;the grass is withered, the new growth fails,    the verdure is no more.
Therefore the abundance they have gained    and what they have laid upthey carry away    over the Brook of the Willows.
For a cry has gone    round the land of Moab;the wailing reaches to Egla′im,    the wailing reaches to Beer-e′lim.
For the waters of Dibon are full of blood;    yet I will bring upon Dibon even more,a lion for those of Moab who escape,    for the remnant of the land.
