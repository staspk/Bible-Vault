Arise, shine; for your light has come,    and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.
For behold, darkness shall cover the earth,    and thick darkness the peoples;but the Lord will arise upon you,    and his glory will be seen upon you.
And nations shall come to your light,    and kings to the brightness of your rising.
Lift up your eyes round about, and see;    they all gather together, they come to you;your sons shall come from far,    and your daughters shall be carried in the arms.
Then you shall see and be radiant,    your heart shall thrill and rejoice;because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you,    the wealth of the nations shall come to you.
A multitude of camels shall cover you,    the young camels of Mid′ian and Ephah;    all those from Sheba shall come.They shall bring gold and frankincense,    and shall proclaim the praise of the Lord.
All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you,    the rams of Nebai′oth shall minister to you;they shall come up with acceptance on my altar,    and I will glorify my glorious house.
Who are these that fly like a cloud,    and like doves to their windows?
For the coastlands shall wait for me,    the ships of Tarshish first,to bring your sons from far,    their silver and gold with them,for the name of the Lord your God,    and for the Holy One of Israel,    because he has glorified you.
Foreigners shall build up your walls,    and their kings shall minister to you;for in my wrath I smote you,    but in my favor I have had mercy on you.
Your gates shall be open continually;    day and night they shall not be shut;that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations,    with their kings led in procession.
For the nation and kingdom    that will not serve you shall perish;    those nations shall be utterly laid waste.
The glory of Lebanon shall come to you,    the cypress, the plane, and the pine,to beautify the place of my sanctuary;    and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
The sons of those who oppressed you    shall come bending low to you;and all who despised you    shall bow down at your feet;they shall call you the City of the Lord,    the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
Whereas you have been forsaken and hated,    with no one passing through,I will make you majestic for ever,    a joy from age to age.
You shall suck the milk of nations,    you shall suck the breast of kings;and you shall know that I, the Lord, am your Savior    and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
Instead of bronze I will bring gold,    and instead of iron I will bring silver;instead of wood, bronze,    instead of stones, iron.I will make your overseers peace    and your taskmasters righteousness.
Violence shall no more be heard in your land,    devastation or destruction within your borders;you shall call your walls Salvation,    and your gates Praise.
The sun shall be no more    your light by day,nor for brightness shall the moon    give light to you by night;but the Lord will be your everlasting light,    and your God will be your glory.
Your sun shall no more go down,    nor your moon withdraw itself;for the Lord will be your everlasting light,    and your days of mourning shall be ended.
Your people shall all be righteous;    they shall possess the land for ever,the shoot of my planting, the work of my hands,    that I might be glorified.
The least one shall become a clan,    and the smallest one a mighty nation;I am the Lord;    in its time I will hasten it.
