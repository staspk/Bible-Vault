Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the belly of the fish,
saying,“I called to the Lord, out of my distress,    and he answered me;out of the belly of Sheol I cried,    and thou didst hear my voice.
For thou didst cast me into the deep,    into the heart of the seas,    and the flood was round about me;all thy waves and thy billows    passed over me.
Then I said, ‘I am cast out    from thy presence;how shall I again look    upon thy holy temple?’
The waters closed in over me,    the deep was round about me;weeds were wrapped about my head
at the roots of the mountains.I went down to the land    whose bars closed upon me for ever;yet thou didst bring up my life from the Pit,    O Lord my God.
When my soul fainted within me,    I remembered the Lord;and my prayer came to thee,    into thy holy temple.
Those who pay regard to vain idols    forsake their true loyalty.
But I with the voice of thanksgiving    will sacrifice to thee;what I have vowed I will pay.    Deliverance belongs to the Lord!”
And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
