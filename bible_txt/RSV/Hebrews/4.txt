Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest remains, let us fear lest any of you be judged to have failed to reach it.
For good news came to us just as to them; but the message which they heard did not benefit them, because it did not meet with faith in the hearers.
For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said,“As I swore in my wrath,‘They shall never enter my rest,’”although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.
For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way, “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.”
And again in this place he said,“They shall never enter my rest.”
Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,
again he sets a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted,“Today, when you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts.”
For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not speak later of another day.
So then, there remains a sabbath rest for the people of God;
for whoever enters God’s rest also ceases from his labors as God did from his.
Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, that no one fall by the same sort of disobedience.
For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
And before him no creature is hidden, but all are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.
Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
