Therefore, holy brethren, who share in a heavenly call, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.
He was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in God’s house.
Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory than Moses as the builder of a house has more honor than the house.
(For every house is built by some one, but the builder of all things is God.)
Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,
but Christ was faithful over God’s house as a son. And we are his house if we hold fast our confidence and pride in our hope.
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,“Today, when you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,on the day of testing in the wilderness,
where your fathers put me to the testand saw my works for forty years.
Therefore I was provoked with that generation,and said, ‘They always go astray in their hearts;they have not known my ways.’
As I swore in my wrath,‘They shall never enter my rest.’”
Take care, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.
But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
For we share in Christ, if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end,
while it is said,“Today, when you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
Who were they that heard and yet were rebellious? Was it not all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?
And with whom was he provoked forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
And to whom did he swear that they should never enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
