It shall come to pass in the latter days    that the mountain of the house of the Lordshall be established as the highest of the mountains,    and shall be raised up above the hills;and peoples shall flow to it,
and many nations shall come, and say:“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,    to the house of the God of Jacob;that he may teach us his ways    and we may walk in his paths.”For out of Zion shall go forth the law,    and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
He shall judge between many peoples,    and shall decide for strong nations afar off;and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,    and their spears into pruning hooks;nation shall not lift up sword against nation,    neither shall they learn war any more;
but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree,    and none shall make them afraid;    for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken.
For all the peoples walk    each in the name of its god,but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God    for ever and ever.
In that day, says the Lord,    I will assemble the lameand gather those who have been driven away,    and those whom I have afflicted;
and the lame I will make the remnant;    and those who were cast off, a strong nation;and the Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion    from this time forth and for evermore.
And you, O tower of the flock,    hill of the daughter of Zion,to you shall it come,    the former dominion shall come,    the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
Now why do you cry aloud?    Is there no king in you?Has your counselor perished,    that pangs have seized you like a woman in travail?
Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion,    like a woman in travail;for now you shall go forth from the city    and dwell in the open country;    you shall go to Babylon.There you shall be rescued,    there the Lord will redeem you    from the hand of your enemies.
Now many nations    are assembled against you,saying, “Let her be profaned,    and let our eyes gaze upon Zion.”
But they do not know    the thoughts of the Lord,they do not understand his plan,    that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor.
Arise and thresh,    O daughter of Zion,for I will make your horn iron    and your hoofs bronze;you shall beat in pieces many peoples,    and shall devote their gain to the Lord,    their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.
