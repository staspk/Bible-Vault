Then the Lord said to Job,
“Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty?Let him who rebukes God give an answer.”
Then Job answered the Lord and said,
“Behold, I am insignificant; what can I say in response to You?I put my hand on my mouth.
I have spoken once, and I will not reply;Or twice, and I will add nothing more.”
Then the Lord answered Job from the whirlwind and said,
“Now tighten the belt on your waist like a man;I will ask you, and you instruct Me.
Will you really nullify My judgment?Will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?
Or do you have an arm like God,And can you thunder with a voice like His?
“Adorn yourself with pride and dignity,And clothe yourself with honor and majesty.
Let out your outbursts of anger,And look at everyone who is arrogant, and humble him.
Look at everyone who is arrogant, and humble him,And trample down the wicked where they stand.
Hide them together in the dust;Imprison them in the hidden place.
Then I will also confess to you,That your own right hand can save you.
“Behold, Behemoth, which I made as well as you;He eats grass like an ox.
Behold, his strength in his waist,And his power in the muscles of his belly.
He hangs his tail like a cedar;The tendons of his thighs are knit together.
His bones are tubes of bronze;His limbs are like bars of iron.
“He is the first of the ways of God;Let his Maker bring His sword near.
Indeed the mountains bring him food,And all the animals of the field play there.
He lies down under the lotus plants,In the hiding place of the reeds and the marsh.
The lotus plants cover him with shade;The willows of the brook surround him.
If a river rages, he is not alarmed;He is confident, though the Jordan rushes to his mouth.
Can anyone capture him when he is on watch,Can anyone pierce his nose with barbs?
