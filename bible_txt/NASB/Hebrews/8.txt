Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord set up, not man.
For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.
Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law;
who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, “See,” He says, “that you make all things by the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain.”
But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, to the extent that He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.
For if that first covenant had been free of fault, no circumstances would have been sought for a second.
For in finding fault with the people, He says,“Behold, days are coming, says the Lord,When I will bring about a new covenantWith the house of Israel and the house of Judah,
Not like the covenant which I made with their fathersOn the day I took them by the handTo bring them out of the land of Egypt;For they did not continue in My covenant,And I did not care about them, says the Lord.
For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of IsraelAfter those days, declares the Lord:I will put My laws into their minds,And write them on their hearts.And I will be their God,And they shall be My people.
And they will not teach, each one his fellow citizen,And each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’For they will all know Me,From the least to the greatest of them.
For I will be merciful toward their wrongdoings,And their sins I will no longer remember.”
When He said, “A new covenant,” He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is about to disappear.
