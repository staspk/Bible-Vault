Therefore, we must fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.
For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also did; but the word they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united with those who listened with faith.
For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said,“As I swore in My anger,They certainly shall not enter My rest,”although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.
For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day: “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works”;
and again in this passage, “They certainly shall not enter My rest.”
Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who previously had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,
He again sets a certain day, “Today,” saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before,“Today if you hear His voice,Do not harden your hearts.”
For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that.
Consequently, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.
Therefore let’s make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience.
For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, even penetrating as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we must answer.
Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let’s hold firmly to our confession.
For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things just as we are, yet without sin.
Therefore let’s approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for help at the time of our need.
