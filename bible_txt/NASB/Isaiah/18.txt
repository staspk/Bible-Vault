Woe, land of whirring wingsWhich lies beyond the rivers of Cush,
Which sends messengers by the sea,Even in papyrus vessels on the surface of the waters.Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth,To a people feared far and wide,A powerful and oppressive nationWhose land the rivers divide.
All you who inhabit the world, and live on earth,As soon as a flag is raised on the mountains, you will see it,And as soon as the trumpet is blown, you will hear it.
For this is what the Lord has told me:“I will quietly look from My dwelling placeLike dazzling heat in the sunshine,Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”
For before the harvest, as soon as the bud blossomsAnd the flower becomes a ripening grape,He will cut off the shoots with pruning knives,And remove and tear away the spreading branches.
They will be left together for mountain birds of prey,And for the animals of the earth;And the birds of prey will spend the summer feeding on them,And all the animals of the earth will spend harvest time on them.
At that time a gift of tribute will be brought to the Lord of armiesFrom a people tall and smooth,From a people feared far and wide,A powerful and oppressive nation,Whose land the rivers divide—To the place of the name of the Lord of armies, to Mount Zion.
