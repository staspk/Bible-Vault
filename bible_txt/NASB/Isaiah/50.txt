This is what the Lord says:“Where is the certificate of divorceBy which I have sent your mother away?Or to whom of My creditors did I sell you?Behold, you were sold for your wrongdoings,And for your wrongful acts your mother was sent away.
Why was there no one when I came?When I called, why was there no one to answer?Is My hand so short that it cannot redeem?Or do I have no power to rescue?Behold, I dry up the sea with My rebuke,I turn rivers into a wilderness;Their fish stink for lack of water,And die of thirst.
I clothe the heavens with blackness,And make sackcloth their covering.”
The Lord God has given Me the tongue of disciples,So that I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word.He awakens Me morning by morning,He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple.
The Lord God has opened My ear,And I was not disobedient,Nor did I turn back.
I gave My back to those who strike Me,And My cheeks to those who pull out My beard;I did not hide My face from insults and spitting.
For the Lord God helps Me,Therefore, I am not disgraced;Therefore, I have made My face like flint,And I know that I will not be ashamed.
He who vindicates Me is near;Who will contend with Me?Let us stand up to each other.Who has a case against Me?Let him approach Me.
Behold, the Lord God helps Me;Who is he who condemns Me?Behold, they will all wear out like a garment;A moth will eat them.
Who is among you who fears the Lord,Who obeys the voice of His servant,Who walks in darkness and has no light?Let him trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God.
Behold, all you who kindle a fire,Who encircle yourselves with flaming arrows,Walk in the light of your fireAnd among the flaming arrows you have set ablaze.This you will have from My hand:You will lie down in torment.
