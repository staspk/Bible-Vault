Then you will say on that day,“I will give thanks to You, Lord;For although You were angry with me,Your anger is turned away,And You comfort me.
Behold, God is my salvation,I will trust and not be afraid;For the Lord God is my strength and song,And He has become my salvation.”
Therefore you will joyously draw waterFrom the springs of salvation.
And on that day you will say,“Give thanks to the Lord, call on His name.Make known His deeds among the peoples;Make them remember that His name is exalted.”
Praise the Lord in song, for He has done glorious things;Let this be known throughout the earth.
Rejoice and shout for joy, you inhabitant of Zion,For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.
