The pronouncement concerning Moab:Certainly in a night Ar of Moab is devastated and ruined;Certainly in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and ruined.
The people have gone up to the temple and to Dibon, to the high places to weep.Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba;Everyoneâ€™s head is bald and every beard is cut off.
In their streets they have put on sackcloth;On their housetops and in their public squaresEveryone is wailing, overcome with weeping.
Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out,Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz;Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud;His soul trembles within him.
My heart cries out for Moab;His fugitives are as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah,For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping;Indeed, on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over their collapse.
For the waters of Nimrim are desolate.Indeed, the grass is withered, the new growth has died,There is no greenery.
Therefore the abundance which they have acquired and stored up,They carry it off over the brook of Arabim.
For the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab,Its wailing goes as far as Eglaim and its howling to Beer-elim.
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood;I will certainly bring added woes upon Dimon,A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and the remnant of the land.
