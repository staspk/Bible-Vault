This is what the Lord says:“Guard justice and do righteousness,For My salvation is about to comeAnd My righteousness to be revealed.
Blessed is a man who does this,And a son of man who takes hold of it;Who keeps from profaning the Sabbath,And keeps his hand from doing any evil.”
Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the Lord say,“The Lord will certainly separate me from His people.”Nor let the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dry tree.”
For this is what the Lord says:“To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths,And choose what pleases Me,And hold firmly to My covenant,
To them I will give in My house and within My walls a memorial,And a name better than that of sons and daughters;I will give them an everlasting name which will not be eliminated.
“Also the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord,To attend to His service and to love the name of the Lord,To be His servants, every one who keeps the Sabbath so as not to profane it,And holds firmly to My covenant;
Even those I will bring to My holy mountain,And make them joyful in My house of prayer.Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar;For My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.”
The Lord God, who gathers the dispersed of Israel, declares,“I will yet gather others to them, to those already gathered.”
All you wild animals,All you animals in the forest,Come to eat.
His watchmen are blind,All of them know nothing.All of them are mute dogs unable to bark,Dreamers lying down, who love to slumber;
And the dogs are greedy, they are never satisfied.And they are shepherds who have no understanding;They have all turned to their own way,Each one to his unjust gain, without exception.
“Come,” they say, “let’s get wine, and let’s drink heavily of intoxicating drink;And tomorrow will be like today, only more so.”
