Now as to the periods and times, brothers and sisters, you have no need of anything to be written to you.
For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord is coming just like a thief in the night.
While they are saying, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction will come upon them like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, so that the day would overtake you like a thief;
for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness;
so then, let’s not sleep as others do, but let’s be alert and sober.
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk, get drunk at night.
But since we are of the day, let’s be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.
For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him.
Therefore, encourage one another and build one another up, just as you also are doing.
But we ask you, brothers and sisters, to recognize those who diligently labor among you and are in leadership over you in the Lord, and give you instruction,
and that you regard them very highly in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another.
We urge you, brothers and sisters, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone.
See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek what is good for one another and for all people.
Rejoice always,
pray without ceasing,
in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.
Do not quench the Spirit,
do not utterly reject prophecies,
but examine everything; hold firmly to that which is good,
abstain from every form of evil.
Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will do it.
Brothers and sisters, pray for us.
Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.
I put you under oath by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
