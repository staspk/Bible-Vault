“Come, let’s return to the Lord.For He has torn us, but He will heal us;He has wounded us, but He will bandage us.
He will revive us after two days;He will raise us up on the third day,That we may live before Him.
So let’s learn, let’s press on to know the Lord.His appearance is as sure as the dawn;And He will come to us like the rain,As the spring rain waters the earth.”
What shall I do with you, Ephraim?What shall I do with you, Judah?For your loyalty is like a morning cloud,And like the dew which goes away early.
Therefore I have cut them in pieces by the prophets;I have slain them by the words of My mouth;And the judgments on you are like the light that shines.
For I desire loyalty rather than sacrifice,And the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
But like Adam they have violated the covenant;There they have dealt treacherously with Me.
Gilead is a city of wrongdoers,Tracked with bloody footprints.
And as a band of robbers lie in wait for a person,So a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem;Certainly they have committed an act of infamy.
In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing;Ephraim’s infidelity is there, Israel has defiled itself.
Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you,When I restore the fortunes of My people.
