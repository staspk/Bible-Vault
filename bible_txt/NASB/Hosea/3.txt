Then the Lord said to me, “Go again, love a woman who is loved by her husband, yet is committing adultery, as the Lord loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.”
So I purchased her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver, and a homer and a lethech of barley.
Then I said to her, “You shall live with me for many days. You shall not play the prostitute, nor shall you have another man; so I will also be toward you.”
For the sons of Israel will live for many days without a king or leader, without sacrifice or memorial stone, and without ephod or household idols.
Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the Lord and to His goodness in the last days.
