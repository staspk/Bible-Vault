Return, Israel, to the Lord your God,For you have stumbled because of your wrongdoing.
Take words with you and return to the Lord.Say to Him, “Take away all guiltAnd receive us graciously,So that we may present the fruit of our lips.
Assyria will not save us,We will not ride on horses;Nor will we say again, ‘Our god’To the work of our hands;For in You the orphan finds mercy.”
I will heal their apostasy,I will love them freely,Because My anger has turned away from them.
I will be like the dew to Israel;He will blossom like the lily,And he will take root like the cedars of Lebanon.
His shoots will sprout,His majesty will be like the olive tree,And his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon.
Those who live in his shadowWill again raise grain,And they will blossom like the vine.His fame will be like the wine of Lebanon.
Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols?It is I who answer and look after you.I am like a luxuriant juniper;From Me comes your fruit.
Whoever is wise, let him understand these things;Whoever is discerning, let him know them.For the ways of the Lord are right,And the righteous will walk in them,But wrongdoers will stumble in them.
