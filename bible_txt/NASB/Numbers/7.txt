Now on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it with all its furnishings, and the altar and all its utensils; he anointed them and consecrated them also.
Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ households, made an offering (they were the leaders of the tribes; they were the supervisors over the numbered men).
When they brought their offering before the Lord, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two of the leaders and an ox for each one, then they presented them in front of the tabernacle.
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
“Accept these things from them, that they may be used in the service of the tent of meeting, and you shall give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service.”
So Moses took the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service,
and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
But he did not give any to the sons of Kohath, because theirs was the service of the holy objects, which they carried on the shoulder.
And the leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed, so the leaders offered their offering before the altar.
Then the Lord said to Moses, “They shall present their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar.”
