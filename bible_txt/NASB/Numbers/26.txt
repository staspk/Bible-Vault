Then it came about after the plague, that the Lord spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
“Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ households, whoever is able to go to war in Israel.”
So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
“Among these the land shall be divided as an inheritance according to the number of names.
To a larger group you shall increase their inheritance, and to a smaller group you shall decrease their inheritance; each shall be given their inheritance corresponding to the total of those who were numbered of them.
But the land shall be divided by lot. They shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
Corresponding to the selection by lot, their inheritance shall be divided between the larger and the smaller groups.”

And to Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the Lord.
Those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and upward, for they were not numbered among the sons of Israel since no inheritance was given to them among the sons of Israel.
These are the ones who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
But among these there was not a man of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
For the Lord had said of them, “They shall certainly die in the wilderness.” And not a man was left of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.
