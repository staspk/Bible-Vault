These are the journeys of the sons of Israel, by which they came out of the land of Egypt by their armies, under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
Moses recorded their starting places according to their journeys by the command of the Lord, and these are their journeys according to their starting places.
Now they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the Passover the sons of Israel started out boldly in the sight of all the Egyptians,

They camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim, in the plains of Moab.
Then the Lord spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying,
“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from you, and destroy all their idolatrous sculptures, destroy all their cast metal images, and eliminate all their high places;
and you shall take possession of the land and live in it, for I have given the land to you to possess it.
You shall maintain the land as an inheritance by lot according to your families; to the larger you shall give more inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give less inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to anyone, that shall be his. You shall pass on land as an inheritance according to the tribes of your fathers.
But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from you, then it will come about that those whom you let remain of them will be like thorns in your eyes and like pricks in your sides, and they will trouble you in the land in which you live.
And just as I plan to do to them, I will do to you.’”
