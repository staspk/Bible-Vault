So I will send fire upon MoabAnd it will consume the citadels of Kerioth;And Moab will die amid the panic of battle,Amid war cries and the sound of a trumpet.
I will also eliminate the judge from her midstAnd slay all her leaders with him,” says the Lord.
This is what the Lord says:“For three offenses of Judah, and for four,I will not revoke its punishment,Because they rejected the Law of the LordAnd have not kept His statutes;Their lies also have led them astray,Those which their fathers followed.
So I will send fire upon Judah,And it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem.”

Behold, I am making a rut in the ground beneath you,Just as a wagon makes a rut when filled with sheaves.
Refuge will be lost from the swift,And the strong will not strengthen his power,Nor the warrior save his life.
The one who grasps the bow will not stand his ground,The swift of foot will not escape,Nor will the one who rides the horse save his life.
Even the bravest among the warriors will flee naked on that day,” declares the Lord.
