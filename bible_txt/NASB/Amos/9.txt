I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said,“Strike the pillar capitals so that the thresholds will shake,And break them on the heads of them all!Then I will put to death the rest of them with the sword;They will not have a fugitive who will flee,Nor a survivor who will escape.
Though they dig into Sheol,From there My hand will take them;And though they ascend to heaven,From there I will bring them down.
And though they hide on the summit of Carmel,I will track them down and take them from there;And though they hide themselves from My sight on the bottom of the sea,I will command the serpent from there, and it will bite them.
And though they go into captivity before their enemies,From there I will command the sword and it will kill them,And I will set My eyes against them for harm and not for good.”
The Lord God of armies,The One who touches the land so that it quakes,And all those who live in it mourn,And all of it rises up like the NileAnd subsides like the Nile of Egypt;
The One who builds His upper chambers in the heavensAnd has founded His vaulted dome over the earth,He who calls for the waters of the seaAnd pours them out on the face of the earth,The Lord is His name.
“Are you not as the sons of Ethiopia to Me,You sons of Israel?” declares the Lord.“Have I not brought up Israel from the land of Egypt,And the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?
Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are on the sinful kingdom,And I will eliminate it from the face of the earth;Nevertheless, I will not totally eliminate the house of Jacob,”Declares the Lord.
“For behold, I am commanding,And I will shake the house of Israel among all nationsAs grain is shaken in a sieve,But not a pebble will fall to the ground.
All the sinners of My people will die by the sword,Those who say, ‘The catastrophe will not overtake or confront us.’
“On that day I will raise up the fallen shelter of David,And wall up its gaps;I will also raise up its ruinsAnd rebuild it as in the days of old;
So that they may possess the remnant of EdomAnd all the nations who are called by My name,”Declares the Lord who does this.
“Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord,“When the plowman will overtake the reaper,And the one who treads grapes will overtake him who sows the seed;When the mountains will drip grape juice,And all the hills will come apart.
I will also restore the fortunes of My people Israel,And they will rebuild the desolated cities and live in them;They will also plant vineyards and drink their wine,And make gardens and eat their fruit.
I will also plant them on their land,And they will not be uprooted again from their landWhich I have given them,”Says the Lord your God.
