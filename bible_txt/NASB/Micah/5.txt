This One will be our peace.When the Assyrian invades our land,When he tramples on our citadels,Then we will raise against himSeven shepherds and eight leaders of people.

Then the remnant of JacobWill be among many peoplesLike dew from the Lord,Like showers on vegetationThat do not wait for man,Or delay for mankind.

Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries,And all your enemies will be eliminated.
“And it will be on that day,” declares the Lord,“That I will eliminate your horses from among you,And destroy your chariots.
I will also eliminate the cities of your land,And tear down all your fortifications.
I will eliminate sorceries from your hand,And you will have no fortune-tellers.
I will eliminate your carved imagesAnd your memorial stones from among you,So that you will no longer bow downTo the work of your hands.
I will uproot your Asherim from among you,And destroy your cities.
And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrathOn the nations which have not obeyed.”
