“Truly, truly I say to you, the one who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber.
But the one who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep.
To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
When he puts all his own sheep outside, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
However, a stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”
Jesus told them this figure of speech, but they did not understand what the things which He was saying to them meant.
So Jesus said to them again, “Truly, truly I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
All those who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came so that they would have life, and have it abundantly.
“I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters the flock.
He flees because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.
I am the good shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me,
just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.
And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will listen to My voice; and they will become one flock, with one shepherd.
For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I may take it back.
No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it back. This commandment I received from My Father.”
Dissension occurred again among the Jews because of these words.
Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?”
Others were saying, “These are not the words of one who is demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of those who are blind, can it?”
At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem;
it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple area, in the portico of Solomon.
The Jews then surrounded Him and began saying to Him, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”
Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father’s name, these testify of Me.
But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep.
My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;
and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.
My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.
I and the Father are one.”
The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him.
Jesus replied to them, “I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?”
The Jews answered Him, “We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God.”
Jesus answered them, “Has it not been written in your Law: ‘I said, you are gods’?
If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be nullified),
are you saying of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?
If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;
but if I do them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.”
Therefore they were seeking again to arrest Him, and He eluded their grasp.
And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He stayed there.
Many came to Him and were saying, “While John performed no sign, yet everything John said about this Man was true.”
And many believed in Him there.
