Finally, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it was also with you;
and that we will be rescued from troublesome and evil people; for not all have the faith.
But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.
We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing, and will do, what we command.
May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the perseverance of Christ.
Now we command you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother or sister who leads a disorderly life and not one in accordance with the tradition which you received from us.
For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined way among you,
nor did we eat anyoneâ€™s bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we kept working night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you;
not because we do not have the right to this, but in order to offer ourselves as a role model for you, so that you would follow our example.
For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either.
For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies.
Now we command and exhort such persons in the Lord Jesus Christ to work peacefully and eat their own bread.
But as for you, brothers and sisters, do not grow weary of doing good.
If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that person so as not to associate with him, so that he will be put to shame.
And yet do not regard that person as an enemy, but admonish that one as a brother or sister.
Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
