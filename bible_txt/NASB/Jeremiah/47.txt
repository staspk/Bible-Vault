The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh conquered Gaza.
This is what the Lord says:“Behold, waters are going to rise from the northAnd become an overflowing torrent,And overflow the land and everything that is in it,The city and those who live in it;And the people will cry out,And every inhabitant of the land will wail.
Because of the noise of the galloping hoofs of his stallions,The roar of his chariots, and the rumbling of his wheels,The fathers have not turned back for their children,Because of the debility of their hands,
Because of the day that is comingTo destroy all the Philistines,To eliminate from Tyre and SidonEvery surviving ally;For the Lord is going to destroy the Philistines,The remnant of the coastland of Caphtor.
Baldness has come upon Gaza;Ashkelon has been destroyed.Remnant of their valley,How long will you gash yourself?
Ah, sword of the Lord,How long will you not be quiet?Withdraw into your sheath;Rest and stay still.
How can it be quiet,When the Lord has given it an order?Against Ashkelon and against the sea shore—There He has summoned it.”
