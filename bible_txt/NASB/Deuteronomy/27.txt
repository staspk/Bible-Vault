Then Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, “Keep all the commandments which I am commanding you today.
So it shall be on the day when you cross the Jordan to the land which the Lord your God is giving you, that you shall set up for yourself large stones and coat them with lime
and write on them all the words of this Law, when you cross over, so that you may enter the land which the Lord your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your fathers, promised you.
So it shall be when you cross the Jordan, you shall set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I am commanding you today, and you shall coat them with lime.
Moreover, you shall build there an altar to the Lord your God, an altar of stones; you shall not wield an iron tool on them.
You shall build the altar of the Lord your God of uncut stones, and you shall offer on it burnt offerings to the Lord your God;
and you shall sacrifice peace offerings and eat there, and rejoice before the Lord your God.
You shall write on the stones all the words of this Law very clearly.”
Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying, “Be silent and listen, Israel! This day you have become a people for the Lord your God.
So you shall obey the Lord your God, and do His commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today.”
Moses also commanded the people on that day, saying,
“When you cross the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
For the curse, these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
The Levites shall then respond and say to all the people of Israel with a loud voice,
‘Cursed is the person who makes a carved image or cast metal image, an abomination to the Lord, the work of the hands of a craftsman, and sets it up in secret.’ And all the people shall reply and say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is one who treats his father or mother contemptuously.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is one who displaces his neighbor’s boundary marker.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is one who misleads a person who is blind on the road.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is one who distorts the justice due a stranger, an orphan, or a widow.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his father’s wife, because he has uncovered his father’s garment.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is one who has sexual intercourse with any animal.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or of his mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his mother-in-law.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is he who attacks his neighbor in secret.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to attack an innocent person.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is anyone who does not fulfill the words of this Law by doing them.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
