Now all the earth used the same language and the same words.
And it came about, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
Then they said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks and fire them thoroughly.” And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.
And they said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let’s make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of all the earth.”
Now the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the men had built.
And the Lord said, “Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they have started to do, and now nothing which they plan to do will be impossible for them.
Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.”
So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth; and they stopped building the city.
Therefore it was named Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.

and Arpachshad lived 403 years after he fathered Shelah, and he fathered other sons and daughters.
Shelah lived thirty years, and fathered Eber;
and Shelah lived 403 years after he fathered Eber, and he fathered other sons and daughters.

Terah lived seventy years, and fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
Now these are the records of the generations of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot.
Haran died during the lifetime of his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah.
Sarai was unable to conceive; she did not have a child.
Now Terah took his son Abram, and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram’s wife, and they departed together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan; and they went as far as Haran and settled there.
The days of Terah were 205 years; and Terah died in Haran.
