Now these are the records of the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and sons were born to them after the flood.
The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
From these the people of the coastlands of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations.
The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.
Now Cush fathered Nimrod; he became a mighty one on the earth.
He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the Lord.”
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
From that land he went to Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,
and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
Mizraim fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines), and Caphtorim.
Canaan fathered Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth,
the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite,
the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite,
the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad.
The territory of the Canaanite extended from Sidon going toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; and going toward Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, and by their nations.
Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, and the older brother of Japheth, children were born.
The sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
Arpachshad fathered Shelah; and Shelah fathered Eber.
Two sons were born to Eber; the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.
Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all of these were the sons of Joktan.
Now their settlement extended from Mesha going toward Sephar, the hill country of the east.
These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, and according to their nations.
These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their descendants, by their nations; and out of these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood.
