He entered a synagogue again; and a man was there whose hand was withered.
And they were watching Him closely to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.
He *said to the man with the withered hand, “Get up and come forward!”
And He *said to them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?” But they kept silent.
After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He *said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
The Pharisees went out and immediately began conspiring with the Herodians against Him, as to how they might put Him to death.
Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a large multitude from Galilee followed, and also from Judea,
and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, a great number of people heard about everything that He was doing and came to Him.
And He told His disciples to see that a boat would be ready for Him because of the masses, so that they would not crowd Him;
for He had healed many, with the result that all those who had diseases pushed in around Him in order to touch Him.
And whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they would fall down before Him and shout, “You are the Son of God!”
And He strongly warned them not to reveal who He was.
And He *went up on the mountain and *summoned those whom He Himself wanted, and they came to Him.
And He appointed twelve, so that they would be with Him and that He could send them out to preach,
and to have authority to cast out the demons.
And He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter),
James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to them He gave the name Boanerges, which means, “Sons of Thunder”);
and Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;
and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
And He *came home, and the crowd *gathered again, to such an extent that they could not even eat a meal.
And when His own people heard about this, they came out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, “He has lost His senses.”
The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and “He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons.”
And so He called them to Himself and began speaking to them in parables: “How can Satan cast out Satan?
And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but he is finished!
But no one can enter the strong man’s house and plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.
“Truly I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons and daughters of men, and whatever blasphemies they commit;
but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”—
because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”
Then His mother and His brothers *came, and while standing outside they sent word to Him, calling for Him.
And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they *said to Him, “Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You.”
Answering them, He *said, “Who are My mother and My brothers?”
And looking around at those who were sitting around Him, He *said, “Here are My mother and My brothers!
For whoever does the will of God, this is My brother, and sister, and mother.”
