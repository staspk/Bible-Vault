The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet:“Behold, I am sending My messenger before You,Who will prepare Your way;
The voice of one calling out in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way of the Lord,Make His paths straight!’”
John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the country of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
John was clothed with camel’s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and his diet was locusts and wild honey.
And he was preaching, saying, “After me One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to bend down and untie the straps of His sandals.
I baptized you with water; but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon Him;
and a voice came from the heavens: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.”
And immediately the Spirit *brought Him out into the wilderness.
And He was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild animals, and the angels were serving Him.
Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,
and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent and believe in the gospel.”
As He was going along the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, “Follow Me, and I will have you become fishers of people.”
Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
And going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, who were also in the boat mending the nets.
Immediately He called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and went away to follow Him.
They *went into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach.
And they were amazed at His teaching; for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
saying, “What business do You have with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are: the Holy One of God!”
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!”
After throwing him into convulsions and crying out with a loud voice, the unclean spirit came out of him.
And they were all amazed, so they debated among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.”
Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding region of Galilee.
And immediately after they left the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and they immediately *spoke to Jesus about her.
And He came to her and raised her up, taking her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she served them.
Now when evening came, after the sun had set, they began bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed.
And the whole city had gathered at the door.
And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.
And in the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went away to a secluded place, and prayed there for a time.
Simon and his companions eagerly searched for Him;
and they found Him and *said to Him, “Everyone is looking for You.”
He *said to them, “Let’s go somewhere else to the towns nearby, so that I may also preach there; for this is why I came.”
And He went into their synagogues preaching throughout Galilee, and casting out the demons.
And a man with leprosy *came to Jesus, imploring Him and kneeling down, and saying to Him, “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”
Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out with His hand and touched him, and *said to him, “I am willing; be cleansed.”
And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.
And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away,
and He *said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”
But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news around, to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city, but stayed out in unpopulated areas; and they were coming to Him from everywhere.
