“I am the rose of Sharon,The lily of the valleys.”The Groom
“Like a lily among the thorns,So is my darling among the young women.”The Bride
“Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,So is my beloved among the young men.In his shade I took great delight and sat down,And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
He has brought me to his banquet hall,And his banner over me is love.
Refresh me with raisin cakes,Sustain me with apples,Because I am lovesick.
His left hand is under my head,And his right hand embraces me.”The Groom
“Swear to me, you daughters of Jerusalem,By the gazelles or by the does of the field,That you will not disturb or awaken my loveUntil she pleases.”The Bride
“Listen! My beloved!Behold, he is coming,Leaping on the mountains,Jumping on the hills!
My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.Behold, he is standing behind our wall,He is looking through the windows,He is peering through the lattice.
“My beloved responded and said to me,‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one,And come along.
For behold, the winter is past,The rain is over and gone.
The blossoms have already appeared in the land;The time has arrived for pruning the vines,And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land.
The fig tree has ripened its fruit,And the vines in blossom have given forth their fragrance.Arise, my darling, my beautiful one,And come along!’”The Groom
“My dove, in the clefts of the rock,In the hiding place of the mountain pathway,Let me see how you look,Let me hear your voice;For your voice is pleasant,And you look delightful.”The Chorus
“Catch the foxes for us,The little foxes that are ruining the vineyards,While our vineyards are in blossom.”The Bride
“My beloved is mine, and I am his;He pastures his flock among the lilies.
Until the cool of the day, when the shadows flee,Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelleOr a young stag on the mountains of Bether.”
