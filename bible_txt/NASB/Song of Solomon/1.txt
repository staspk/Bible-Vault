The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.The Bride
“May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!For your love is sweeter than wine.
Your oils have a pleasing fragrance,Your name is like purified oil;Therefore the young women love you.
Draw me after you and let’s run together!The king has brought me into his chambers.”The Chorus“We will rejoice in you and be joyful;We will praise your love more than wine.Rightly do they love you.”The Bride
“I am black and beautiful,You daughters of Jerusalem,Like the tents of Kedar,Like the curtains of Solomon.
Do not stare at me because I am dark,For the sun has tanned me.My mother’s sons were angry with me;They made me caretaker of the vineyards,But I have not taken care of my own vineyard.
Tell me, you whom my soul loves,Where do you pasture your flock,Where do you have it lie down at noon?For why should I be like one who veils herselfBeside the flocks of your companions?”
“If you yourself do not know,Most beautiful among women,Go out on the trail of the flock,And pasture your young goatsBy the tents of the shepherds.
“To me, my darling, you are likeMy mare among the chariots of Pharaoh.
Your cheeks are delightful with jewelry,Your neck with strings of beads.”The Chorus
“We will make for you jewelry of goldWith beads of silver.”The Bride
“While the king was at his table,My perfume gave forth its fragrance.
My beloved is to me a pouch of myrrhWhich lies all night between my breasts.
My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossomsIn the vineyards of Engedi.”The Groom
“How beautiful you are, my darling,How beautiful you are!Your eyes are like doves.”The Bride
“How handsome you are, my beloved,And so delightful!Indeed, our bed is luxuriant!
The beams of our house are cedars,Our rafters, junipers.
