The word of the Lord came again to me, saying,
“Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says:“Wail, ‘Woe for the day!’
For the day is near,Indeed, the day of the Lord is near;It will be a day of clouds,A time of doom for the nations.
A sword will come upon Egypt,And there will be trembling in Cush;When the slain fall in Egypt,They will take away her wealth,And her foundations will be torn down.
Cush, Put, Lud, all Arabia, Libya and the people of the land that is in league will fall with them by the sword.”
‘This is what the Lord says:“Indeed, those who support Egypt will fallAnd the pride of her power will come down;From Migdol to SyeneThey will fall within her by the sword,”Declares the Lord God.
“They will be desolateIn the midst of the desolated lands;And her cities will beIn the midst of the devastated cities.
And they will know that I am the Lord,When I set a fire in EgyptAnd all her helpers are broken.
On that day messengers will go out from Me in ships to frighten carefree Cush; and trembling will come on them as on the day of Egypt; for behold, it is coming!”
‘This is what the Lord God says:“I will also make the hordes of Egypt ceaseBy the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
He and his people with him,The most ruthless of the nations,Will be brought in to destroy the land;And they will draw their swords against EgyptAnd fill the land with the slain.
Moreover, I will make the Nile canals dryAnd sell the land into the hands of evil men.And I will make the land desolateAnd all that is in it,By the hand of strangers; I the Lord have spoken.”
‘This is what the Lord God says:“I will also destroy the idolsAnd make the images cease from Memphis.And there will no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt;And I will put fear in the land of Egypt.
I will make Pathros desolate,Set a fire in ZoanAnd execute judgments on Thebes.
I will pour out My wrath on Sin,The stronghold of Egypt;I will also eliminate the hordes of Thebes.
I will set a fire in Egypt;Sin will writhe in anguish,Thebes will be breachedAnd Memphis will have distresses daily.
The young men of On and of Pi-besethWill fall by the sword,And the women will go into captivity.
In Tehaphnehes the day will be darkWhen I break there the yoke bars of Egypt.Then the pride of her power will cease in her;A cloud will cover her,And her daughters will go into captivity.
So I will execute judgments on Egypt,And they will know that I am the Lord.”’”
In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, behold, it has not been bound up for healing or wrapped with a bandage, so that it may be strong to wield the sword.
Therefore this is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and I will break his arms, both the strong and the broken; and I will make the sword fall from his hand.
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands.
For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand; and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, so that he will groan before him with the groans of a wounded man.
So I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fail. Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he reaches out with it against the land of Egypt.
When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands, then they will know that I am the Lord.’”
