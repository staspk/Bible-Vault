Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.
Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I handed them down to you.
But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.
Every man who has something on his head while praying or prophesying disgraces his head.
But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her head, for it is one and the same as the woman whose head is shaved.
For if a woman does not cover her head, have her also cut her hair off; however, if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, have her cover her head.
For a man should not have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.
For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man;
for indeed man was not created for the woman’s sake, but woman for the man’s sake.
Therefore the woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.
However, in the Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
For as the woman originated from the man, so also the man has his birth through the woman; and all things originate from God.
Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
Does even nature itself not teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,
but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her as a covering.
But if anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor have the churches of God.
Now in giving this next instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better, but for the worse.
For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it.
For there also have to be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you.
Therefore when you come together it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper,
for when you eat, each one takes his own supper first; and one goes hungry while another gets drunk.
What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What am I to say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you.
For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when He was betrayed, took bread;
and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”
In the same way He also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”
For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.
Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy way, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
But a person must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
For the one who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not properly recognize the body.
For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number are asleep.
But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.
But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.
So then, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
If anyone is hungry, have him eat at home, so that you do not come together for judgment. As to the remaining matters, I will give instructions when I come.
