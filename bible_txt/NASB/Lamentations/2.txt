How the Lord has covered the daughter of ZionWith a cloud in His anger!He has hurledThe glory of Israel from heaven to earth,And has not remembered His footstoolIn the day of His anger.
The Lord has destroyed; He has not sparedAll the settlements of Jacob.In His wrath He has overthrownThe strongholds of the daughter of Judah,He has hurled them down to the ground;He has profaned the kingdom and its leaders.
In fierce anger He has cut offAll the strength of Israel;He has pulled back His right handFrom the enemy.And He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fireConsuming on all sides.
He has bent His bow like an enemy;His right hand is positioned like an adversary,And He has killed everything that was pleasant to the eye.In the tent of the daughter of ZionHe has poured out His wrath like fire.
The Lord has become like an enemy.He has engulfed Israel;He has engulfed all its palaces,He has destroyed its strongholdsAnd caused great mourning and grieving in the daughter of Judah.
And He has treated His tabernacle violently, like a despised garden;He has destroyed His appointed meeting place.The Lord has causedThe appointed feast and Sabbath in Zion to be forgotten,And He has despised king and priestIn the indignation of His anger.
The Lord has rejected His altar,He has repudiated His sanctuary;He has handed overThe walls of her palaces to the enemy.They have made a noise in the house of the LordAs on the day of an appointed feast.
The Lord determined to destroyThe wall of the daughter of Zion.He has stretched out a line,He has not restrained His hand from destroying,And He has caused rampart and wall to mourn;They have languished together.
Her gates have sunk into the ground,He has destroyed and broken her bars.Her king and her leaders are among the nations;The Law is gone.Her prophets, too, findNo vision from the Lord.
The elders of the daughter of ZionSit on the ground and are silent.They have thrown dust on their heads;They have put on sackcloth.The virgins of JerusalemHave bowed their heads to the ground.
My eyes fail because of tears,My spirit is greatly troubled;My heart is poured out on the earthBecause of the destruction of the daughter of my people,When little ones and infants languishIn the streets of the city.
They say to their mothers,“Where is grain and wine?”As they faint like a wounded personIn the streets of the city,As their lives are poured outIn their mothers’ arms.
How shall I admonish you?What shall I compare to you,Daughter of Jerusalem?What shall I liken to you as I comfort you,Virgin daughter of Zion?For your collapse is as vast as the sea;Who can heal you?
Your prophets have seen for youWorthless and deceptive visions;And they have not exposed your wrongdoingSo as to restore you from captivity,But they have seen for you worthless and misleading pronouncements.
All who pass along the wayClap their hands in ridicule at you;They hiss and shake their headsAt the daughter of Jerusalem:“Is this the city of which they said,‘Perfect in beauty,A joy to all the earth’?”
All your enemiesHave opened their mouths wide against you;They hiss and gnash their teeth.They say, “We have engulfed her!This certainly is the day which we awaited;We have reached it, we have seen it!”
The Lord has done what He determined;He has accomplished His wordWhich He commanded from days of old.He has torn down without sparing,And He has helped the enemy to rejoice over you;He has exalted the might of your adversaries.
Their heart cried out to the Lord:“You wall of the daughter of Zion,Let your tears stream down like a river day and night;Give yourself no relief,Let your eyes have no rest.
Arise, whimper in the nightAt the beginning of the night watches;Pour out your heart like waterBefore the presence of the Lord;Raise your hands to HimFor the life of your little onesWho languish because of hungerAt the head of every street.
See, Lord, and look!With whom have You dealt this way?Should women really eat their children,The little ones who were born healthy?Should priest and prophet really be killedIn the sanctuary of the Lord?
On the ground in the streetsLie young and old;My virgins and my young menHave fallen by the sword.You have put them to death on the day of Your anger,You have slaughtered, without sparing.
You called as on the day of an appointed feastMy terrors on every side;And there was no one who survived or escapedOn the day of the Lord’s anger.As for those whom I brought forth healthy and whom I raised,My enemy annihilated them.”
