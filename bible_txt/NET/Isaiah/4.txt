Seven women will grab hold ofone man at that time.They will say, “We will provide our own food,we will provide our own clothes;but let us belong to you—take away our shame!”
At that timethe crops given by the Lord will bring admiration and honor;the produce of the land will be a source of pride and delightto those who remain in Israel.
Those remaining in Zion, those left in Jerusalem,will be called “holy,”all in Jerusalem who are destined to live.
At that time the Lord will wash the excrement from Zion’s women,he will rinse the bloodstains from Jerusalem’s midst,as he comes to judgeand to bring devastation.
Then the Lord will createover all Mount Zionand over its convocationsa cloud and smoke by dayand a bright flame of fire by night;indeed a canopy will accompany the Lord’s glorious presence.
By day it will be a shelter to provide shade from the heat,as well as safety and protection from the heavy downpour.
