See, a king will reign in righteousness    and rulers will rule with justice.
Each one will be like a shelter from the wind    and a refuge from the storm,like streams of water in the desert    and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.
Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed,    and the ears of those who hear will listen.
The fearful heart will know and understand,    and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.
No longer will the fool be called noble    nor the scoundrel be highly respected.
For fools speak folly,    their hearts are bent on evil:They practice ungodliness    and spread error concerning the Lord;the hungry they leave empty    and from the thirsty they withhold water.
Scoundrels use wicked methods,    they make up evil schemesto destroy the poor with lies,    even when the plea of the needy is just.
But the noble make noble plans,    and by noble deeds they stand.
You women who are so complacent,    rise up and listen to me;you daughters who feel secure,    hear what I have to say!
In little more than a year    you who feel secure will tremble;the grape harvest will fail,    and the harvest of fruit will not come.
Tremble, you complacent women;    shudder, you daughters who feel secure!Strip off your fine clothes    and wrap yourselves in rags.
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields,    for the fruitful vines
and for the land of my people,    a land overgrown with thorns and briers—yes, mourn for all houses of merriment    and for this city of revelry.
The fortress will be abandoned,    the noisy city deserted;citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever,    the delight of donkeys, a pasture for flocks,
till the Spirit is poured on us from on high,    and the desert becomes a fertile field,    and the fertile field seems like a forest.
The Lord’s justice will dwell in the desert,    his righteousness live in the fertile field.
The fruit of that righteousness will be peace;    its effect will be quietness and confidence forever.
My people will live in peaceful dwelling places,    in secure homes,    in undisturbed places of rest.
Though hail flattens the forest    and the city is leveled completely,
how blessed you will be,    sowing your seed by every stream,    and letting your cattle and donkeys range free.
