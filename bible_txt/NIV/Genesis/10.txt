This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah’s sons, who themselves had sons after the flood.The Japhethites
The sons of Japheth:Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshek and Tiras.
The sons of Gomer:Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah.
The sons of Javan:Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites and the Rodanites.
(From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.)The Hamites
The sons of Ham:Cush, Egypt, Put and Canaan.
The sons of Cush:Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteka.The sons of Raamah:Sheba and Dedan.
Cush was the father of Nimrod, who became a mighty warrior on the earth.
He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; that is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord.”
The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in Shinar.
From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah
and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah—which is the great city.
Egypt was the father ofthe Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,
Pathrusites, Kasluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites.
Canaan was the father ofSidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,
Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,
Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,
Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites.Later the Canaanite clans scattered
and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, as far as Lasha.
These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.The Semites
Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.
The sons of Shem:Elam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram.
The sons of Aram:Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshek.
Arphaxad was the father of Shelah,and Shelah the father of Eber.
Two sons were born to Eber:One was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan.
Joktan was the father ofAlmodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.
The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.
These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
