and all the villages around these towns as far as Baalath Beer (Ramah in the Negev).This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Simeonites, according to its clans.
The inheritance of the Simeonites was taken from the share of Judah, because Judah’s portion was more than they needed. So the Simeonites received their inheritance within the territory of Judah.

These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Dan, according to its clans.
When they had finished dividing the land into its allotted portions, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them,
as the Lord had commanded. They gave him the town he asked for—Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim. And he built up the town and settled there.
These are the territories that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel assigned by lot at Shiloh in the presence of the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting. And so they finished dividing the land.
