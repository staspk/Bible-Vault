And he will be our peace    when the Assyrians invade our land    and march through our fortresses.We will raise against them seven shepherds,    even eight commanders,

Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies,    and all your foes will be destroyed.
“In that day,” declares the Lord,“I will destroy your horses from among you    and demolish your chariots.
I will destroy the cities of your land    and tear down all your strongholds.
I will destroy your witchcraft    and you will no longer cast spells.
I will destroy your idols    and your sacred stones from among you;you will no longer bow down    to the work of your hands.
I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles    when I demolish your cities.
I will take vengeance in anger and wrath    on the nations that have not obeyed me.”
