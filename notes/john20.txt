John 20
While still dark, on Sunday, Mary Magdalene, visits tomb. John 20:1
"So she ran" to: Simon Peter,and "the disciple whom Jesus loved" John 20:2a
“They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” John 20:2b =>
{
	We implies more than one person,
	ran implies she did not stop to tell anyone,
	Almost certainly, Mary Magdalene was not alone in going to the tomb
	John 20:1-2 => 
}

John outruns Peter and stoops to look in at the linen clothes lying there, but does not go in. John 20:3-5
Peter goes in, sees the linen clothes, and the face-cloth/napkin rolled up on its own. John 20:6-7
John follows him in "and he saw and believed" John 20:8
The two disciple go back home. John 20:10

Sunday Midday(?) -> 1'st Appearance to Mary Magdalene
Mary stays crying at the tomb. John 20:11a
Looking into the tomb, she sees 2 angels who ask her: "“Woman, why are you weeping?” John 20:11b-13a
“Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” John 20:13
“I have seen the Lord”, Mary to the disciples. John 20:18

Sunday Evening -> 1'st Appearance to Disciples
“Peace be with you" John 20:19
“Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.” John 20:21
He breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit." John 20:22
If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.” John 20:23 =>
{
	Receiving the Holy Spirit
	is related to the phenomena of v.23
	...?
}

“We have seen the Lord.” The Disciples to Thomas, who missed the event. John 20:25a
“Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and place my finger in the mark of the nails, and place my hand in his side, I will not believe.” John 20:25b

Monday, 8 days Later => 2nd Appearance to Disciples
Same house as last time, door is shut like last time, Thomas is now with disciples...
Jesus appears: “Peace be with you.”
“Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side; do not be faithless, but believing.” John 20:27
Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” John 20:28
Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.” John 20:29

Appearance 3 -> to 7 disciples at the Sea of Tiberias

Jerusalem to Tiberius (City on western side of the Sea of Galilee) => {
	~73 miles, direct line
	~94 miles, assuming a roundabout "down from Jerusalem" North-Western route
	My guess: this event is at minimum two weeks later / maybe a month. I think there's a cap of 90 days for Jesus Post-Resurrection Earthly Days?
}

Jesus: “Children, have you any fish?” [disciples ~100 yards from the shore]
“No.”
“Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”
...
John, to Peter: “It is the Lord!”
Jesus: “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.”
“Come and have breakfast.”

None dared ask: “Who are you?”. They knew it was the Lord.

Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish. John 21:13
